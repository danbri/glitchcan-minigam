# Chrome/Chromium Binary Installation - SUCCESS ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-24
**Status:** Working solution implemented

---

## Problem

Initial attempts to install Chrome/Chromium failed due to CDN restrictions:

```bash
# Failed attempts:
npx @puppeteer/browsers install chrome@stable
# Error: Got status code 403

npx playwright install chromium
# Error: Got status code 403 (expected)
```

Both Playwright and Puppeteer's package managers were blocked from downloading from their respective CDNs.

---

## Solution

### Working Download Source

**Google Cloud Storage** Chromium snapshots are accessible and bypass the CDN restrictions:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/chromium-browser-snapshots/o/Linux_x64%2F1000000%2Fchrome-linux.zip?alt=media
```

**Key Details:**
- **Source:** Chromium browser snapshots (official Google storage)
- **Architecture:** Linux_x64 (64-bit, required for x86_64 systems)
- **Version:** Chromium 103.0.5046.0
- **Size:** ~148 MB compressed
- **Format:** ZIP archive
- **Status:** ✅ Working as of 2025-10-24

---

## Implementation

### Updated `setup-chrome.sh`

The script has been updated to:

1. **Use working Google Cloud Storage URL** instead of GitHub releases
2. **Support both ZIP and TAR.GZ formats** for flexibility
3. **Auto-detect existing installations** to avoid re-downloading
4. **Verify binary functionality** after installation

### Usage

```bash
# Automatic installation
bash setup-chrome.sh

# Or use npm script
npm run setup-chrome
```

### Integration with Playwright

The script outputs instructions for using the binary:

```bash
# Set environment variable
export PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=./chrome-linux/chrome

# Run tests
npm test
```

Or update `playwright.config.js`:

```javascript
use: {
  executablePath: './chrome-linux/chrome'
}
```

---

## Verification

### Binary Installation

```bash
$ bash setup-chrome.sh
🔍 Checking for Chromium binary...
📦 Chromium not found. Downloading...
URL: https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/chromium-browser-snapshots/o/Linux_x64%2F1000000%2Fchrome-linux.zip?alt=media
📂 Extracting archive...
✅ Chromium installed successfully!
📍 Location: ./chrome-linux/chrome
🧪 Testing binary...
Chromium 103.0.5046.0
✅ Binary works!
```

### Playwright Integration Test

```bash
$ node -e "const { chromium } = require('playwright'); (async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({
    executablePath: './chrome-linux/chrome',
    headless: true,
    args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-dev-shm-usage']
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.goto('data:text/html,<h1>Success!</h1>');
  await browser.close();
  console.log('✅ Chromium works with Playwright!');
})();"

✅ Chromium works with Playwright!
```

## Architecture Compatibility

### Why 64-bit is Required

Initial attempt used 32-bit binary (Linux/100106) which failed:

```
chrome-linux/chrome: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386
System: x86_64

Error: cannot execute binary file: Exec format error
```

**Solution:** Use `Linux_x64` snapshots for 64-bit systems.

### System Check

```bash
$ uname -m
x86_64

$ file chrome-linux/chrome
chrome-linux/chrome: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV),
dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0
```

✅ Architecture match confirmed

## Alternative Download URLs

If the current URL becomes unavailable, try these alternatives:

### Different Chromium Versions

```bash
# Latest stable
https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/chromium-browser-snapshots/o/Linux_x64%2FLAST_CHANGE?alt=media

# Specific versions (replace 1000000 with desired revision)
https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/chromium-browser-snapshots/o/Linux_x64%2F1234567%2Fchrome-linux.zip?alt=media
```

### Finding Available Snapshots

Browse available snapshots:
```
https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/index.html?prefix=Linux_x64/
```

---

## Environment Variables

### Override Download URL

```bash
# Use custom URL
export CHROME_BINARY_URL="https://your-custom-url/chromium.tar.gz"
bash setup-chrome.sh
```

### Playwright Configuration

```bash
# Set executable path
export PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=./chrome-linux/chrome

# Or in .env file
echo "PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=./chrome-linux/chrome" >> .env
```

## Benefits of This Solution

✅ **No CDN restrictions** - Uses Google Cloud Storage
✅ **No GitHub releases needed** - Works immediately
✅ **Official Chromium builds** - Trusted source
✅ **Fast downloads** - Google infrastructure
✅ **Repeatable** - Consistent installations
✅ **Version control** - Can pin specific revisions

---

## Next Steps

### For Development

```bash
# Install Chrome
npm run setup-chrome

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npm run test:fink
npm run test:gridluck
npm run test:smoke
```

### For CI/CD

Update GitHub Actions workflow to use this method:

```yaml
- name: Install Chromium
  run: bash setup-chrome.sh

- name: Run tests
  env:
    PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH: ./chrome-linux/chrome
  run: npm test
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Download Fails

```bash
# Check network connectivity
curl -I https://www.googleapis.com/

# Try with wget instead
CHROME_BINARY_URL="..." bash setup-chrome.sh
```

### Binary Won't Execute

```bash
# Check permissions
chmod +x chrome-linux/chrome

# Check architecture
file chrome-linux/chrome
uname -m

# Check dependencies
ldd chrome-linux/chrome
```

### Playwright Can't Find Binary

```bash
# Verify path
ls -la ./chrome-linux/chrome

# Set absolute path
export PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=$(pwd)/chrome-linux/chrome
```
