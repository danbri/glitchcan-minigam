- **Variable Tracking**: player_reputation, chess_skill, investigation_style, time_pressure
- **External Integration**: JavaScript minigame communicates back to story

## Direct Links for Testing

The story supports direct navigation to specific scenes for debugging and demonstration:

## Chess Integration

### Mamikon Mini-Chess Component
- **Position**: Pre-configured tactical position from story context
- **Queen Sacrifice**: White has played an aggressive queen sacrifice
- **Performance Tracking**: Player moves analyzed for tactical understanding

### Performance Levels
- **Brilliant (80+ points)**: Unlocks chess evidence theory, maximum reputation bonus
- **Good (50-79 points)**: Solid understanding, moderate reputation bonus  
- **Decent (25-49 points)**: Basic analysis, standard progression
- **Needs Improvement (<25 points)**: Limited chess insights

## Story Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Range |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `player_reputation` | Detective's professional standing | 50-85+ |
| `investigation_style` | Player's approach to detection | observational/procedural/direct/psychological |
| `time_pressure` | Urgency tracker, decreases with actions | 3 to 0 |
| `chess_skill` | Performance in minigame | 0-100 |
| `chess_insights` | Type of chess analysis achieved | brilliant_analysis/good_understanding/basic_analysis |

## Files

- **`shane-manor.fink.js`** - Main story file with INK content
- **`mamikon-minichess.js`** - Standalone chess minigame component
- **`test-minichess.html`** - Integration testing interface
- **Media assets** - Located in `media/shane/` directory

## Usage

### In FINK Player
1. Load story via Table of Contents ‚Üí Games ‚Üí Shane Manor
2. Follow investigation choices to reach chess scene
3. Play chess position to influence story outcome
4. Complete deduction based on gathered evidence

### Direct Testing

2. Use direct links to jump to specific story sections
3. Check CI validation with `fink-validation.yml` workflow

## Technical Notes

### FINK Integration
The story demonstrates proper FINK structure:
```ink
# MINIGAME: chess
# SCRIPT: mamikon-minichess.js  
# CONFIG: {"position": "shane_manor", "onComplete": "chess_analysis"}
```

### Chess Callback
The minigame updates story variables via callback:
```javascript
onGameEnd: function(performance, queenSacrifice, moveHistory) {
    // Updates chess_skill variable based on performance
    // Enables conditional story branches
}
```

### Image Assets
Story uses optimized images from `media/shane/` with BASEHREF path resolution:
```ink
# BASEHREF: media/shane/
# IMAGE: desktop/manor_with_taxi_desktop.jpg
```

## Development

### Testing
- **Local**: Run HTTP server and open `test-minichess.html`
- **CI**: Automated validation via GitHub Actions
- **Story**: Load in FINK Player v5/v6 for full integration test

### Validation
```bash
cd inklet/validation
node checkfink.mjs ../shane-manor.fink.js
```
