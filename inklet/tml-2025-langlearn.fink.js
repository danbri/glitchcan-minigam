Awesome! Now that you know some food words, let‚Äôs look at a bit of **Ukrainian grammar**.

In Ukrainian, nouns change form depending on their role in a sentence ‚Äî this is called **case**.

Let‚Äôs start with two:
- **Nominative** (subject)
- **Accusative** (object)

-> grammar_case_example

=== grammar_case_example ===
Here are some examples:

üü¢ **Nominative** (used for the subject of the sentence):  
- –¶–µ **—Ö–ª—ñ–±**. (This is bread.)  
- **–°–∏—Ä** —Å–º–∞—á–Ω–∏–π. (The cheese is tasty.)  
- **–Ø–±–ª—É–∫–æ** –∑–µ–ª–µ–Ω–µ. (The apple is green.)

üîµ **Accusative** (used for the object of the sentence):  
- –Ø —ó–º **—Ö–ª—ñ–±**. (I eat bread.)  
- –í–æ–Ω–∞ –∫—É–ø—É—î **—Å–∏—Ä**. (She buys cheese.)  
- –í—ñ–Ω —ó—Å—Ç—å **–∫–æ–≤–±–∞—Å—É**. (He eats sausage.)

Now let's practice!
-> case_practice_bread

=== case_practice_bread ===
Choose the correct form of "bread" in this sentence:

"–Ø —ó–º ___." (I am eating ___.)

+ —Ö–ª—ñ–±
    ~ correct_answers++
    -> case_bread_correct
+ —Ö–ª—ñ–±–∞
    -> case_bread_wrong
+ —Ö–ª—ñ–±–æ–º
    -> case_bread_wrong

=== case_bread_correct ===
Correct! "–•–ª—ñ–±" remains the same in the accusative case (masculine inanimate nouns often do).
-> case_practice_cheese

=== case_bread_wrong ===
Not quite! The correct form is "—Ö–ª—ñ–±".
-> case_practice_cheese

=== case_practice_cheese ===
"–í–æ–Ω–∞ –∫—É–ø—É—î ___." (She is buying ___ ‚Äî "cheese")

+ —Å–∏—Ä
    ~ correct_answers++
    -> case_cheese_correct
+ —Å–∏—Ä—É
    -> case_cheese_wrong
+ —Å–∏—Ä–æ–º
    -> case_cheese_wrong

=== case_cheese_correct ===
Nice! "–°–∏—Ä" doesn't change here in accusative either.
-> case_practice_sausage

=== case_cheese_wrong ===
"–°–∏—Ä" is correct in this sentence. Try to remember how masculine inanimate nouns behave!
-> case_practice_sausage

=== case_practice_sausage ===
"–í—ñ–Ω —ó—Å—Ç—å ___." (He is eating ___ ‚Äî "sausage")

+ –∫–æ–≤–±–∞—Å–∞
    -> sausage_wrong_nominative
+ –∫–æ–≤–±–∞—Å—É
    ~ correct_answers++
    -> sausage_correct
+ –∫–æ–≤–±–∞—Å–æ—é
    -> sausage_wrong_instrumental

=== sausage_correct ===
Exactly! Feminine nouns ending in "-–∞" often change to "-—É" in the accusative case.
-> grammar_review

=== sausage_wrong_nominative ===
That‚Äôs the nominative form. In this sentence, we need the accusative: "–∫–æ–≤–±–∞—Å—É".
-> grammar_review

=== sausage_wrong_instrumental ===
"–ö–æ–≤–±–∞—Å–æ—é" is instrumental case ‚Äî not used here.
-> grammar_review

=== grammar_review ===
‚úÖ Great job! Here's a quick grammar recap using food:

**Nominative (Subject)**  
- –¶–µ —Ö–ª—ñ–±.  
- –°–∏—Ä —Å–º–∞—á–Ω–∏–π.  
- –Ø–±–ª—É–∫–æ –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–µ.  

**Accusative (Object)**  
- –Ø —ó–º —Ö–ª—ñ–±.  
- –í–æ–Ω–∞ –∫—É–ø—É—î —Å–∏—Ä.  
- –í—ñ–Ω —ó—Å—Ç—å –∫–æ–≤–±–∞—Å—É.

Remember:
- Masculine inanimate nouns often stay the same.  
- Feminine nouns often change "-–∞" ‚Üí "-—É" in accusative.
