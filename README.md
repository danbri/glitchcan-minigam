# Glitch Canary Minigames

A [collection](https://danbri.github.io/glitchcan-minigam/) of very experimental browser-based minigames, sloppy by design. Investigating possibilities around player-generated sloppy AI minigames within a larger framework.

## Experiments

### Thumbwar
A fluid dynamics game where players use their thumbs to bend fluid streams and catch targets. Play on a touchscreen device for the best experience.

### Inklet
An interactive story game with emoji-based scenes and branching narratives. Choose your actions carefully to explore different storylines.
