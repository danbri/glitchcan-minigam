# App2 - FINK + Minigame Integration (Experimental)

**Status:** Bleeding Edge / Experimental
**Entry Point:** `/app2/index.html`
**TOC:** `/app2/toc.fink.js`

---

## What is App2?

App2 is an experimental entry point that extends the FINK player with **state-sharing capabilities between INK narrative and JavaScript minigames**, building toward the peer architecture proposed in `PEER_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md`.

This completes the work started in `gamgam-wc.html` by creating a modular, testable implementation using the `gcfink` library.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Minigame State Sharing
- **INK variables ‚Üí Minigame:** Games receive INK state as initial configuration
- **Minigame ‚Üí INK variables:** Game results update INK story variables
- **Two-way flow:** Enables narrative branches based on gameplay outcomes

### 2. Event-Based Architecture
- Custom events for component coordination
- Decoupled minigame components
- Easy to add new minigames without modifying core code

### 3. Built on gcfink Library
- Uses `extractFinkFromJsSource()` for FINK content extraction
- Uses `compileInk()` with real inkjs compiler
- Modular, testable architecture

```

---

## State Sharing Flow

### Example: Score Game

**1. INK Story Defines Variables:**
```ink
=== simple_score_demo ===
Your current score: {minigame_score}

# MINIGAME: simple-score
# MINIGAME_PASS: player_name
# MINIGAME_RECEIVE: score, attempts

+ [Play Game] -> launch_score_game
```

**2. App Detects MINIGAME Tag:**
```javascript
const minigameTag = tags.find(t => t.startsWith('MINIGAME:'));
if (minigameTag) {
    const gameName = minigameTag.split(':')[1].trim();
    launchMinigame(gameName);
}
```

**3. Minigame Executes:**
```javascript
function launchMinigame(gameName) {
    // Show minigame UI
    minigameContainer.classList.add('active');

    // Player plays...
    // On completion:
    completeMinigame({ score: 150, attempts: 1 });
}
```

**4. Results Update INK:**
```javascript
function completeMinigame(results) {
    // Update INK variables
    currentStory.variablesState.minigame_score = results.score;
    currentStory.variablesState.minigame_attempts = results.attempts;

    // Hide minigame, continue story
    minigameContainer.classList.remove('active');
    continueStory();
}
```

**5. Story Continues with New State:**
```ink
=== score_game_complete ===
You scored: {minigame_score} points!

{minigame_score > 100:
    Excellent! You unlocked a bonus path.
    + [Bonus Area] -> bonus_path
- else:
    Try again for a higher score.
    + [Retry] -> launch_score_game
}
```

## Differences from inklet/app

| Feature | inklet/app | app2 |
|---------|-----------|------|
| **Purpose** | Production FINK player | Experimental minigame integration |
| **Architecture** | Standalone modular JS | gcfink library + modules |
| **Minigames** | None | State-sharing demos |
| **Entry Point** | inklet/app/index.html | app2/index.html |
| **TOC** | ../inklet/toc.fink.js | app2/toc.fink.js |
| **Status** | Stable | Bleeding edge |

**Key Insight:** app2 does NOT replace inklet/app. They coexist independently.

---

## Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
cd app2

# Test app2 functionality
node test-app2.mjs

# Verify existing app unchanged
node test-baseline.mjs
```

### Test Coverage

- INK compilation with gcfink ‚úÖ
- MINIGAME tag detection ‚úÖ
- State variable handling ‚úÖ
- Minigame container rendering ‚úÖ
- Existing inklet/app unchanged ‚úÖ

## Demo Content (app2/toc.fink.js)

### Minigame Demos
1. **Simple Score Game** - Demonstrates score passing
2. **Inventory Game** - Demonstrates list/boolean state
3. **GamGam Integration** - Links to full gamgam-wc.html

### Classic Episodes
- Hampstead (from main app)
- Bagend (from main app)

Demonstrates that app2 can load existing FINK content without breaking it.

### Current Limitations
1. **Demo minigames only** - Button-based simulations, not real Canvas games
2. **No persistence** - State not saved between sessions
3. **No multiplayer** - NetworkService not implemented
4. **Limited testing** - Browser testing needed (only Node tests currently)

### Not Yet Implemented
- Canvas-based retro games (planned)
- Achievement system (designed in PEER_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md)
- Cloud save sync (designed in PEER_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md)
- Leaderboards (designed in PEER_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md)
- Multiplayer rooms (designed in PEER_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md)

## Contributing

### Adding a New Minigame

**1. Create FINK content with MINIGAME tag:**
```ink
=== my_game_demo ===
# MINIGAME: my-game
# MINIGAME_PASS: player_level
# MINIGAME_RECEIVE: score, items_collected

+ [Play My Game] -> launch_my_game
```

**2. Add minigame handler in index.html:**
```javascript
if (gameName === 'my-game') {
    minigameInstructions.textContent = 'Play my game!';

    const playButton = createMinigameButton('Start', () => {
        // Game logic here
        completeMinigame({ score: 100, items_collected: 5 });
    });

    minigameControls.appendChild(playButton);
}
```

**3. Test:**
```bash
node test-app2.mjs
```

---

## Debugging

### Enable Debug Console
Click the **DEBUG** button in the bottom-right corner or:
```javascript
CONFIG.DEBUG_ENABLED = true
```

### Debug Output Shows:
- FINK file loading progress
