# Headless Browser Testing for Glitchcan Minigames

## Status: Framework Ready, Browser Installation Blocked

This document describes the headless browser testing infrastructure created for the Glitchcan Minigames collection.

### Current Situation

**✅ Completed:**
- Playwright test framework installed
- Comprehensive test suites written for:
  - FINK Player (interactive fiction engine)
  - GridLuck (grid-based game)
  - General minigame smoke tests (9 games)
- Configuration files created
- Documentation written

**❌ Blocked:**
- Browser download fails with 403 Forbidden errors
- Both Playwright and Puppeteer unable to download Chromium
- Network restrictions prevent CDN access

**Next Steps:**
- Run tests in unrestricted environment (local dev machine or CI/CD)
- Install browsers successfully
- Execute test suites

---

## Quick Start (Unrestricted Environment)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install chromium

# 3. Start local server (in separate terminal)
npm run server

# 4. Run tests
npm test
```

## Test Suites

### 1. FINK Player Tests (`tests/fink-player.spec.js`)

Comprehensive testing of the modular FINK interactive fiction player:

**Core Functionality:**
- ✅ Player loads without errors

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, claude/* ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Environment

1. **Browser Download Blocked**
   - 403 Forbidden from Playwright CDN
   - 403 Forbidden from Puppeteer Chrome CDN
   - Cannot install Chromium via system packages (restricted apt repos)

2. **Workaround Required**
   - Must run in unrestricted environment
   - Local dev machine recommended
   - Or GitHub Actions CI/CD

### Test-Specific Notes

1. **Visual Regression Tests**
   - Screenshot comparisons may fail on first run
   - Update baselines with: `npx playwright test --update-snapshots`

2. **Performance Tests**
   - FPS measurements may vary by system
   - Memory tests require Chrome DevTools Protocol

3. **Mobile Tests**
   - Touch events simulated, not real device
   - Use BrowserStack/Sauce Labs for real device testing

---

## Existing Validation Tools

The project already has FINK-specific validation:

### `inklet/validation/checkfink.mjs`

Puppeteer-based validator for INK/FINK files:

```bash
cd inklet/validation
npm install  # Already done
node checkfink.mjs --scan  # Scan entire repo
node checkfink.mjs path/to/story.fink.js  # Validate specific file
```

**Features:**
- Real ink-full.js compilation
- Browser-based execution (no regex hackparsing)
- Supports .ink, .json, .fink.js files
- Exit codes for CI/CD integration

**Current Issue:**
- Requires Puppeteer to download browser (same 403 error)
- Will work once browser installed

---

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Install Playwright
- [x] Create test framework structure
- [x] Write comprehensive test suites
- [x] Document configuration
- [x] Update package.json scripts

### Phase 2: PENDING (Requires Unrestricted Environment)
- [ ] Install Chromium browser successfully
- [ ] Run tests locally to verify
- [ ] Update baselines for visual regression
- [ ] Fix any failing tests

### Phase 3: PENDING
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Test in CI/CD environment
- [ ] Add status badges to README
- [ ] Set up test result reporting

### Phase 4: PENDING
- [ ] Expand coverage to all 20+ minigames
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking
- [ ] Add cross-browser testing (Firefox, WebKit)
- [ ] Add real device testing integration

---

## Alternative: MCP Chrome DevTools

If MCP Chrome DevTools server is available, it could provide:
- Real-time debugging during development
- Live DOM inspection
- Network monitoring
- Performance profiling

**Check availability:**
```bash
# Look for MCP config
cat ~/.claude/mcp_config.json

# Or check for MCP servers
ls ~/.claude/mcp/servers/
```

**Note:** No MCP Chrome DevTools detected in current environment.

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Browser Won't Install

**Try:**
```bash
# Manual Chromium download
wget https://playwright.azureedge.net/builds/chromium/1194/chromium-linux.zip

# Or use system Chrome
export PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/bin/google-chrome

# Or skip browser download and use Docker
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.56.1
```

### Tests Timing Out

**Increase timeouts in `playwright.config.js`:**
```javascript
timeout: 60 * 1000, // 60 seconds instead of 30
```

### Tests Failing Inconsistently

**Enable retries:**
```javascript
retries: 2, // Retry failed tests twice
```

### Need to Debug Specific Test

```bash
# Run specific test file in debug mode
npx playwright test tests/fink-player.spec.js --debug

# Or run specific test by name
npx playwright test -g "should load FINK player"
```

---

## Conclusion

The headless browser testing framework is **fully implemented and ready to use** once browser installation completes in an unrestricted environment. The test suites provide comprehensive coverage of:

- **FINK Player** - Interactive fiction engine with real INK compiler
- **GridLuck** - Complete game mechanics and performance
- **General Minigames** - Smoke tests for 9 different games

**Total: 150+ test assertions** covering initialization, functionality, UI, mobile, performance, and visual regression.

**Next Action:** Run tests in environment with unrestricted CDN access (local machine or GitHub Actions).
