Awesome! Now that you know some food words, let’s look at a bit of **Ukrainian grammar**.

In Ukrainian, nouns change form depending on their role in a sentence — this is called **case**.

Let’s start with two:
- **Nominative** (subject)
- **Accusative** (object)

-> grammar_case_example

=== grammar_case_example ===
Here are some examples:

🟢 **Nominative** (used for the subject of the sentence):  
- Це **хліб**. (This is bread.)  
- **Сир** смачний. (The cheese is tasty.)  
- **Яблуко** зелене. (The apple is green.)

🔵 **Accusative** (used for the object of the sentence):  
- Я їм **хліб**. (I eat bread.)  
- Вона купує **сир**. (She buys cheese.)  
- Він їсть **ковбасу**. (He eats sausage.)

Now let's practice!
-> case_practice_bread

=== case_practice_bread ===
Choose the correct form of "bread" in this sentence:

"Я їм ___." (I am eating ___.)

+ хліб
    ~ correct_answers++
    -> case_bread_correct
+ хліба
    -> case_bread_wrong
+ хлібом
    -> case_bread_wrong

=== case_bread_correct ===
Correct! "Хліб" remains the same in the accusative case (masculine inanimate nouns often do).
-> case_practice_cheese

=== case_bread_wrong ===
Not quite! The correct form is "хліб".
-> case_practice_cheese

=== case_practice_cheese ===
"Вона купує ___." (She is buying ___ — "cheese")

+ сир
    ~ correct_answers++
    -> case_cheese_correct
+ сиру
    -> case_cheese_wrong
+ сиром
    -> case_cheese_wrong

=== case_cheese_correct ===
Nice! "Сир" doesn't change here in accusative either.
-> case_practice_sausage

=== case_cheese_wrong ===
"Сир" is correct in this sentence. Try to remember how masculine inanimate nouns behave!
-> case_practice_sausage

=== case_practice_sausage ===
"Він їсть ___." (He is eating ___ — "sausage")

+ ковбаса
    -> sausage_wrong_nominative
+ ковбасу
    ~ correct_answers++
    -> sausage_correct
+ ковбасою
    -> sausage_wrong_instrumental

=== sausage_correct ===
Exactly! Feminine nouns ending in "-а" often change to "-у" in the accusative case.
-> grammar_review

=== sausage_wrong_nominative ===
That’s the nominative form. In this sentence, we need the accusative: "ковбасу".
-> grammar_review

=== sausage_wrong_instrumental ===
"Ковбасою" is instrumental case — not used here.
-> grammar_review

=== grammar_review ===
✅ Great job! Here's a quick grammar recap using food:

**Nominative (Subject)**  
- Це хліб.  
- Сир смачний.  
- Яблуко велике.  

**Accusative (Object)**  
- Я їм хліб.  
- Вона купує сир.  
- Він їсть ковбасу.

Remember:
- Masculine inanimate nouns often stay the same.  
- Feminine nouns often change "-а" → "-у" in accusative.
